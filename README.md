# File-System

Created a user space portable File System which allows users a 33 MB of drive space in a disk image.
The filesystem uses an indexed allocation scheme and supports file names of up to 32 characters.
Implemented functionalities where the user can create the filesystem image, add files, list files, remove files, execute
command to get the remaining free space in the filesystem etc. Files would persist in the file system even after the
program exits. Functionality to assign an attribute to a file such as hidden and read-only was also implemented.
